1.Access Lab Resources:
Once connected, I can access the lab resources, such as virtual machines, software applications, and data sets, as needed for my work.

2.VPN Connection:
Establish a secure VPN connection to the RPS Lab network. This might involve using a VPN client and entering credentials provided by the RPS Lab.
The VPN connection creates a secure tunnel from my home network to the RPS Lab network, allowing access to resources as if I were physically present in the lab.
