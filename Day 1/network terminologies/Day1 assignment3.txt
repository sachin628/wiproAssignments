Parallel Computing
Real-World Application: Weather Forecasting
Used:
Weather forecasting involves processing vast amounts of meteorological data from satellites, radar, sensors, and other sources to predict weather patterns.
 This task requires the execution of complex numerical models that simulate atmospheric processes.
 These models are computationally intensive and need to run in a timely manner to provide accurate forecasts.
Why It's Important:
1.Speed:-Parallel computing allows these models to run much faster than they would on a single processor.
2.Efficiency

**Networked Systems
Real-World Application: Online Banking
Used:
Online banking systems rely on a network of connected computers to provide banking services over the Internet.
These systems handle a variety of tasks, including processing transactions, updating account information, and providing customer support.
