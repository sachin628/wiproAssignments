Assignment 3: Research and compare SDLC models suitable for engineering projects. Present findings on Waterfall, Agile, Spiral, and V-Model approaches, 
emphasizing their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability in different engineering contexts.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Models
1.Waterfall Model:-It is a step by step process to develop the software.In waterfall model, each stage complete the task one by one. Progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through phases
 such as Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, and Maintenance.
Advantages:
1.Clear structure and easy to understand.
2. Each phase has specific deliverables.
3.Due to its rigid nature, each phase must be completed before the next begins.

disadvatages:
1.Client can review the project only at the end.
2. Only suitable for small projects.
3. High risk if the requirements are not well-understood from the beginning.

When to use waterfall model:-(Applicability)
1.for small scale application. e.g. notepad, alaram app, remainder app
2.Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and where changes are unlikely.

2. Agile Model:- Agile is an iterative and incremental model, which emphasizes flexibility, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of small, functional segments of the application.
In agile we develop the software in sprints, --> particular duration of time (2 to 4 weeks).
Advantages:
1.Flexibility: Easily adaptable to changes.
2.Customer Involvement: Regular feedback from the customer ensures the product meets their needs.
3.Early and Predictable Delivery: Features are delivered incrementally, improving predictability.

Disadvantages:
1.Less Predictable: Can be less predictable due to its iterative nature.
2.Documentation: Focuses less on documentation and more on code development.

where we use agile model:-
1. from mid level to large level project we can use agile.
2. when the requirements are continuously changing.

3.Spiral Model:- the software are developed based on iterations.The Spiral Model combines iterative development (prototyping) with the systematic aspects of the Waterfall Model.
 It focuses on risk assessment and minimizing project risk by breaking the project into smaller segments.

Advantages
1.Risk Management: Emphasis on identifying and reducing risks early.
2.Flexibility: Incorporates changes based on feedback throughout the lifecycle.
3.Customer Satisfaction: Continuous customer involvement ensures the product meets their expectations.

Disadvantages:
1.Complexity: Can be complex to manage.
2.Cost: Can be expensive due to the extensive risk analysis and iterative nature.
3.Time-Consuming: Prolonged due to repeated cycles.

where we use spiral model:-
1.Suitable for large, complex, and high-risk projects.
2.Ideal for projects with unclear or evolving requirements.

4.V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)
The V-Model is an extension of the Waterfall Model, where each development stage is associated with a corresponding testing phase. 
It emphasizes verification and validation processes.

Advantages:
1.High Quality:Ensures high quality through continuous testing.
2.Early Detection of Defects:Errors are detected early,reducing the cost of fixing defects.
3.Structured:Provides a clear and structured approach.

Disadvantages:
1. More documentation (about test plan)
2.Due to extensive testing, the cost can be high.

where we use v-model:-
1.Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements.
2.Ideal for safety-critical systems (e.g., medical devices) where testing is crucial

Comparison:
1.Waterfall vs. Agile:
Waterfall is better for projects with fixed requirements and low risk, while Agile is suitable for dynamic, evolving projects with high customer involvement.
2.Waterfall vs. Spiral:
Waterfall is simpler but less flexible, whereas Spiral provides better risk management and adaptability, making it ideal for high-risk projects.
3.Waterfall vs. V-Model:
V-Model offers improved testing and defect detection compared to Waterfall, making it better for projects where quality is paramount.
4.Agile vs. Spiral:
Agile is preferred for projects needing rapid delivery and continuous customer feedback, whereas Spiral is suitable for high-risk projects requiring extensive risk management.
Agile vs. V-Model:
Agile focuses on adaptability and customer collaboration, making it ideal for evolving requirements, while V-Model is better for projects needing rigorous testing and verification.
